Um, do they have any breaks or lines forateatra?
I see, I see, I see a lot of breaks.
I
Know I'm at a
phone trying to go home all of my change I spent on you
Where are the times gone, baby?
It's all wrong. We are the place we made for two
Yeah
Oh
In paradise
I'm full
I
Even the sun
And all those fairy tales are full of shit But my fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm out of pay for
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you sittin' round
Wondering why I wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars are with a push of a button
Tellin' me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name, I'm not sure you could tell and I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you coulda saw, but sad to say it's over for
Fan of full love, valet, open doors
Wish I go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take that little piece of shit with you
I'm out of gas, but I'm tryin' to hold on
To change the span of you
There have been times gone, baby, it's all right
There have been days we've made part two
And happy ever after didn't exist
I wish to be holdin' you like this
And all these fairy tales are full of shame
Take it upon my fuckin' love song, I'll be sick
Yeah, now I'm at a payphone
