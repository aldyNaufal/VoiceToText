I woke up again in the middle of the lonely
Just a lot of thoughts
Clinging to oneself
Can't come back to forget
The history
When they ask for knowledge
Turned out to be easy
I don't need time, I'm just hurt
Used to pretending to laugh
But let me cry just once
Before lying to myself again
When you're tired, stop it first
Give space, give time
They say just be grateful
Even though it's not as easy as it seems
I don't need time, I'm just hurt
Used to pretending to laugh
But let me cry just once
Before lying to myself again
We're just humans who are hurt
Used to pretending to laugh
But let me cry just once
I don't want to hurt myself anymore
I want to learn how to accept myself
My friend said I'll be fine
It's really hard for me
Always from the past
The beginning is confusing
In the end, everything is cruel
Do you know the pain that has been cured
I haven't been cured yet
I'm going
They say love is in the sky
It's a lie, love ends too
I'm going
Always from the past
The beginning is confusing
In the end, everything is cruel
Do you know the pain that has been cured
I haven't been cured yet
I'm going
Do you know the pain that has been cured
I haven't been cured yet
I'm going
I'm going
They say love is in the sky
It's a lie, love ends too
I'm going
Do you know the pain that has been cured
I haven't been cured yet
I'm going
They say love is in the sky
It's a lie, love ends too
I'm going
If the end ends in love
I'm going
I'm going
